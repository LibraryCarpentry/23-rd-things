## Getting started: Managing data for reuse

Research data is for everyone.  Governments and universities all around Australia and the world are now encouraging researchers to better manage their data so others can use it.

Research data might be critical to solving the big questions of our time, but so much data are being lost or poorly managed.

1. Take just a minute and browse over some ways Queensland Government Data is being used by businesses, families, travellers, farmers.
2. This 4.40mins [cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66oNv_DJuPc) put together by the New York University Health Sciences Library, is about what happens when a researcher hasn't managed their data (at all…) What could possibly go wrong!?
3. As you watch the cartoon jot down the data management mistakes which interest or appal you.
4. Now, scan through the dot points in the Consider the following…. section of the University of the Sunshine Coast's [LibGuide](http://libguides.usc.edu.au/researchdata) which provides advice for researchers on how to manage their data.

**Consider**: how just ONE of the data disasters depicted in the cartoon could have been avoided.

## Learn more: How do you manage “Big Data”?

"Big Data" is a term we're hearing with increasing frequency. Data management for Big Data brings much complexity - citing dynamic data, software, high volume compute, storage costs, transfer of petabytes of data, preservation, provenance, more.

* Read this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140306073407-64875646-big-data-the-5-vs-everyone-must-know) and presentation titled: "Big Data: The 5Vs Everyone Must Know.

  This article uses 5V's: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value as a concept for how big data can be managed more successfully.

**Consider**: your views on whether the concept of 5Vs is useful to support better management and reuse of "Big Data".  If you don't think 5Vs is of value, is there another framework or concept model which could be useful for exploring data management for big data?

## Challenge me: Digital data in eLab Notebooks

Laboratory Notebooks are used by researchers to formally record their research activities. As research has become increasingly digital and collaborative the utility of traditional hard copy Lab Notebooks has been challenged.  Not surprisingly then, eLab Notebooks (ELN) have emerged as an alternative.

Effective data management for constantly updated data, such as that within ELNs, is a real challenge for projects who wish to publish their data during the project.

1. Read this [short](http://esciencelibrary.umassmed.edu/professional-educ/escience-thesaurus/electronic-laboratory-notebook) definition of ELNs
2. Then read [this article](https://opensource.com/life/14/6/international-team-open-sources-search-malaria-cure): International team of scientists open sources search for malaria cure about how an international team of scientists and citizen scientists are using open source ELNs to speed up a cure for malaria.  
3. You can see their open ELNs [here](http://malaria.ourexperiment.org/).  Click on Matthew Todd's ELN to see what it's in it.

**Consider**: your view on a data management issue and possible solutions, where data is generated, stored and shared via an open ELN.
