## Getting started: Building data literacy - what can you do?

We all have a role to play in building a world of data literate citizens.

Enjoy this quirky and clever 1.48min video from a cartoonist:

>## Exploring data literacy resources
>Choose one of the sites from the list below. As you look around the site, think about how you might use these ideas to ‘grow’ your, or other people’s, data literacy:
>* For Universities and research institutes: [Data Information Literacy ](http://www.datainfolit.org/) & [Data Information Literacy Instruction Program Planning](http://guides.lib.purdue.edu/dil)
>* For Federal, State or Local Govt:  [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) & [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

## Learn more:  Data literacy for whom?

People have very diverse needs in terms of what data literacy means for them.

## Challenge me: DIY to build your own data literacy

Technical data wrangling skills are fast becoming a new form of data literacy.  The four Carpentry concepts have really taken off over the past couple of years.

The “hour a week” for 23 (research data) Things doesn’t allow time to do any of the Carpentry modules (most need a couple of hours to complete) but here’s a chance to find out what all the Carpentry buzz is about.

>## Technical data wrangling skills
>Have a look at [this Environmental scan](https://goo.gl/cZk5E6) of courses offering data skills (this is a google doc – if you have trouble opening it, access via link from Thing 17). Then choose 1 Carpentry to explore in depth or browse over them all:
>
>* [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
>* [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/about/)
>* [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
>* [Author Carpentry](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/)
>
> What is one skill you would like to add to your data tool-belt?
{: .challenge}

We will get more hands-on with Carpentry in Thing 21.

>## Value of the Carpentries
>Your ideas or experience about the value of the various Carpentry courses.
