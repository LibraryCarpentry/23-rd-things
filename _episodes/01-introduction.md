## Getting started: What is research data?

What "research data" are we talking about?

* Read an [Introduction to Research Data](http://www.bu.edu/datamanagement/background/whatisdata/) from Boston University


Let’s take a look at data collections.


* Open up this collection: [Data from: A Living Vector Field Reveals Constraints on Galactose Network Induction in Yeast](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb5668210c) in the Digital Collections Research Data Collections.  The research data collected are microscopy images of field cells, a database file, and analysis code used to investigate how cell-level gene expression dynamics produce population-level phenotypes. 

When you are done browsing the data in the first collection, take a look a the data in this second collection:

* Open up this collection: [Santa Fe Light Cone Simulation research project files](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb1673671n) in the Digital Collections Research Data Collections. The project consists of data in three broad categories: the simulation data ("Data at Redshift" components); analysis tools and example scripts (Data Processing Tools) for processing the data; and project administration and background documents (Historical Documents) related to the project. 

***To view collection data:***
* Click on the ***View Collection Items*** button to see the collection.  Next, click on the collection link. Take a look at the metadata and the variety of data formats contained in this one research data collection.


* If you have time: have a look around the [Research Data Collections](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc) and check out the collections and see what other various formats data comes in.

***A different kind of data set:***

One unique example is the [Heavy Metals in the Ocean Insect, Halobates](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb8056206n) collection.  This is an example of ~40 year old computer printed data that was digitized for sharing and preservation.


**Consider**: how the complexity and range of data formats affect access and re-use possibilities.

## Learn More: Data across research disciplines

1. Choose one of the 4 specialized data repositories below, or find another data repository of interest - particularly one in a discipline you are unfamiliar with and spend some time browsing around your chosen repository to get a feel for the data available.

* [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
* [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
* [cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory (caNanoLab)](https://cananolab.nci.nih.gov/caNanoLab/#/)
* USGS Water Data
* [World Ocean Database](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html)

2. Think about how the data here differs from data you are familiar with.  Consider for example, format, size and access method.

**Consider**: how cross disciplinary research could be affected by discipline data conventions, and also think about one way cross disciplinary data access can be facilitated.

## Challenge me: Let’s talk tech!

What is....

* your favorite research data tech or software story or experience
* a software tool or service for research data you think others might be interested in
* a question or research data problem to crowdsource a solution.

**Consider**: a personal audit on what data technical skills you have, and what skills you want to learn.
