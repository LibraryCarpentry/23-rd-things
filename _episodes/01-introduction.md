## Getting started: What is research data?

What "research data" are we talking about?

* Read an [Introduction to Research Data](http://www.bu.edu/datamanagement/background/whatisdata/) from Boston University
* Then open up this record of research data collected during a CSIRO voyage which explored the seafloor (i.e. Benthic zone) of the Marmion Lagoon, located just off Perth, in 2007
* Click on the Data tab to see the rich variety of data formats contained in this one research data collection
* If you have time: have a look around the CSIRO Data Access Portal and see what different formats data comes in.

**Consider**: how the complexity and range of data formats affect access and re-use possibilities.

## Learn More: Data across research disciplines

1. Choose one of the 4 specialized data repositories below, or find another data repository of interest - particularly one in a discipline you are unfamiliar with and spend some time browsing around your chosen repository to get a feel for the data available.

* [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
* [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
* Australian Data Archive
* USGS Water Data

2. Think about how the data here differs from data you are familiar with.  Consider for example, format, size and access method.

**Consider**: how cross disciplinary research could be affected by discipline data conventions, and also think about one way cross disciplinary data access can be facilitated.

## Challenge me: Letâ€™s talk tech!

Get the ball rolling to expand awareness of the technical aspects of data management and this rapidly growing community of tech-aware data enthusiasts.
What is....
* your favorite research data tech or software story or experience
* a software tool or service for research data you think others might be interested in
* a question or research data problem to crowdsource a solution.

**Consider**: a personal audit on what data technical skills you have, and what skills you want to learn.
