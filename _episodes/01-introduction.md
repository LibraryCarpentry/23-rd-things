## Getting started: What is research data?

What "research data" are we talking about?

* Read an Introduction to Research Data from Boston University
* Then open up this record of research data collected during a CSIRO voyage which explored the seafloor (i.e. Benthic zone) of the Marmion Lagoon, located just off Perth, in 2007
* Click on the Data tab to see the rich variety of data formats contained in this one research data collection
* If you have time: have a look around the CSIRO Data Access Portal and see what different formats data comes in.

**Consider**: how the complexity and range of data formats affect access and re-use possibilities.
