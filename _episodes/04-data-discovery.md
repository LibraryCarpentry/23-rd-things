## Getting started: Repositories for data discovery

Repositories enable discovery of data by publishing data descriptions ("metadata") about the data they hold - like a library catalogue describes the materials held in a library.  Most repositories provide access to the data itself, but not always.

Data portals or aggregators draw together research data records from a number of repositories. 
* [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) <!---eg Research Data Australia (RDA) aggregates records from over 100 Australian research repositories.--> is both open source research data repository software and an instance of this repository software hosted by Harvard's  Institute for Quantitative Social Science.
* Click on this [Dataverse record: Replication Data for: What Are The Headwaters of Formal Savings? Experimental Evidence from Sri Lanka](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DGTAKN) <!---from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre: Weddell seals in Antarctica-->

Have a close look at the record to see the ways this record is made discoverable and accessible.  Note how many times this dataset has been downloaded and how to cite this data.  We will look at data citation in more detail in Thing 7.

Spend a few minutes exploring Dataverse:

* Try browsing or searching on a topic of interest
* See which institutions contribute records.  
* Explore a record or two in depth.

**Consider:** the future impact of having a national research data catalog.

## Learn more: Finding data repositories

What data repositories exist and how are researchers sharing their data?

* Start by going to [re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)
* Click on Browse > By Subject > click on a subject in the hierarchy
<!---* There are a surprising number of data repositories listed for Australia.   Does this present all the research data repositories Australia has to offer: is anything missing?-->

**Consider**:  one idea for how you think improved discovery of research data repositories, and the data records they contain, could be achieved.


## Challenge me: Evaluating data repositories
What makes a "good" data repository?  There is much debate about Trusted Repositories and other ways of evaluating repositories - including data repositories.
Have a look at one or both of the resources below
* [DCC checklist for evaluating data repositories](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides-checklists/where-keep-research-data/where-keep-research-data)
* [COINAtlantic Data Accessibility Benchmark tool](http://coinatlantic.ca/index.php/coinatlantic/data-accessibility-benchmark-tool)

Consider: your experiences or thoughts on evaluating data repositories: have you used either or both of these resources?  Would you?
