23 (research data) Things is a self-guided training concept for anybody interested in data. If you are a person who cares for, and about, research data and want to fill in some gaps, learn more or find out about the rapidly changing research data landscape, then this is for you! The program is likely to be of interest to those who:
* care for data: Librarians, Managers, Data custodians
* create data and want recognition for their data
* want to learn more about the potential of data for innovation and start-ups
* are looking to incorporate data into their current or future careers.
